# ServYou - Food Token Generation Web Application

ServYou is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing food purchases within closed organizations such as colleges, IT companies, and similar institutions. It provides users with a convenient platform to generate food tokens, enabling them to purchase food items from designated vendors or cafeterias.

## Overview

ServYou simplifies the food purchasing process by allowing users to generate food tokens through the web application. These tokens can then be used to avail food items, providing a seamless and efficient way to manage food transactions within the organization.

## Key Features

- **Token Generation**: Easily generate food tokens specifying the desired amount and denomination.
  
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized individuals can access the token generation functionality.
  
- **Token Redemption**: Vendors or cafeteria staff can verify and redeem food tokens presented by users for purchasing food items.
  
- **Transaction History**: Users can view their transaction history, promoting transparency and accountability in food purchases.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration/Login**: Users register or log in to the ServYou web application using their credentials.

2. **Token Generation**: Upon successful login, users can generate food tokens by specifying the desired amount and denomination.

3. **Token Redemption**: Users present their generated tokens to designated vendors or cafeteria staff for redemption while purchasing food items.

4. **Transaction Logging**: Each transaction, including token generation and redemption, is logged in the system for reference and tracking purposes.
